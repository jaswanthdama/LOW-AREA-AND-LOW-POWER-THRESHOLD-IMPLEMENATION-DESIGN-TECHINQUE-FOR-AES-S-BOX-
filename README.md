# LOW-AREA-AND-LOW-POWER-THRESHOLD-IMPLEMENATION-DESIGN-TECHINQUE-FOR-AES-S-BOX-
This project presents an optimized hardware implementation of the AES S-Box using Threshold Implementation (TI) techniques. The design focuses on reducing power consumption, minimizing hardware area, and enhancing resistance to side-channel attacksâ€”making it ideal for IoT and embedded systems.
